SpriteKit-VectorMath
====================
A very simple implementation of vector operations in Apple's SpriteKit. 

SpriteKit vector operations largely relay on the types CGVector and CGPoint.

Method names are relatively self explanatory. addVectors: and subtractVectors: work as expected, with order of subtraction occuring in the order the vectors are passed.

sumArray: will return the vector sum of an NSArray of vectors.

magnitude: will return a float magnitude of the passed vector.

Instructions
-----------
Simply 
` #import VectorMath.h `

And you should be all set.
